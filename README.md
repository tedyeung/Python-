# Python 3.6. 

## Enviroment  

#### Visual Studio Code
#### Jupyter Notebooks

#### Spyder
#### Files & Notes are compatible with Python 2.


## Variables 
#### Variables are container where you can store varius date types. 
#### Variables can store all sorts of things, not just numbers. A typical other thing you want to have stored often is a string - a piece of text. Strings are indicated with a starting and ending " (double quote). Youâ€™ll learn about this and other types of data you can store, and what you can do with them later on.
#### Everything inside the quotes "" are strings
#### String has methods associated. For methods you need to use dot notation.
#### Code - dir(variable) -  you can print all avaible methods

### Indexing and Split Strings
#### c = "Hi There!"
#### c[] indexing the string, python start counting from num 0
#### c[0] - output is H; c[2] output is " " 
#### c[-1] output is ! indexing from the end of the string
#### c[0:1] outis H, splitting in Python is upper bound exclusive!!!
#### c[0:2] output is "Hi" 
#### c[-3:-1] output is 're: from the end of the string
