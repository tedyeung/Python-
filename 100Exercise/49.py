Question: The code is supposed to get some input from the user, but instead it produces an error. Please try to understand the error and then fix it.

pass = input("Please enter your password: ") 

Note: Please use raw_input  instead of input if you are on Python 2. For Python 3 input is fine.

password = input("Please enter your password: ") 
print(password)

# pass is a keyword
