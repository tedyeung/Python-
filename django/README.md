# Django is a free and open source web framework
### It is used by many sites, including Pinterest, PBS, Instagram, Bit BitBucket, Mozzila, Washington Times ...

## Django was created in 2003 when the web dvelopers at the Lawrence Jurnal-World newspaper started using Python for their development
## The fact that is originated at a newspaper is important! 
## Because the original developers were surrounded by writers, good written documentation is a key part of Django!
## This means you have excellent references to check on the official Django docs!
## Django has its own excellent basic tutorial where you are walked through creating a basic polling web app.
## The reason it is a poll also extends back to its newspaper roots!
